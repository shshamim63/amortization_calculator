## Problem Description

---

calculator that will help them see the amortization tables given a requested loan amount, interest rate,
term (duration in months) and a request date. Here are some guidelines they have put down:

- Interest is compounded daily.
- The interest amount that accumulates in a particular month is included in the monthly payment
  for that month.
- All monthly payments will be of the same amount.
- All loans are issued on the first of the next month from the requested date.
- Consider a year has 12 months of exactly 30 days each.

The task is to build a system to output a regular schedule that always starts on the first of the
month, displaying:

- the beginning balance at the start of the month
- the principal component of the monthly payment
- the interest component of the monthly payment
- the ending balance assuming the correct payment is made
- the monthly payment itself
